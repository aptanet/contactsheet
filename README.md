Very basic Python GUI to ImageMagick montage command

This is part very rough Python GUI (think no error checking, possibly unsafe to use, etc.!)
and part experiment with Github (getting used to the web GUI side of things).

The code uses PySimpleGUI to allow input of *some* of the parameters for the montage command.

- The code is written and tested in Python 3 and not compatibility checked with Python 2.x
- You will need to *pip3 install PySimpleGUI*
